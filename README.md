## Explanation

1. How do you implement the checklists? Explain in a step-by-step manner
	1. We create a new Django project
 		- We first create a virtual environment by running the command:

    		> python3 -m venv env

     		- To activate the virtual environment, we use:

     		> env\Scripts\activate.bat

     		- I then made a text file named requirements.txt filled with dependencies needed for the project
   
         	- I then installed said dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
